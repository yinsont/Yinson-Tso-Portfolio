                <h1>Background</h1>
                <p>Hello, my name is Yinson and I'm an Asian-American, first child to an immigrant family. Born and raised in NYC.</p>

                <h1>Hobbies</h1>
                <p>I love games and playing in general, sports, video games, card games, thinking games, you name it. I love going for walks and just relaxing, listening to music.</p>

                <h1>Dreams and Aspirations</h1>
                <p>My goal is to somehow make my parents happy and give them a peace of mind so that they can relax. But if we are talking personal, then it's to make a game. I've always loved video games and wish to create my own one day.</p>

                <h1>Programming</h1>
                <p>I left highschool with the ability to use Arduino. I am currently a student at The Flatiron School where I'm learning how to become a Software Engineer. So far, I can confidantly say that I have a firm grasp on Javascript, React, Python, SQL, and HTML.</p>

                <h1>Current Plans?</h1>
                <p>If we're referring to this portfolio, this was made in a rush. The current iteration is not what it's meant to be. It will be updated near the end of my bootcamp.</p>
                <p>I have some more project plans in mind but I'd also like to enter the work force as soon as I can! We shall see how it goes</p>
